### **Stage 1: Project Setup**

This is the foundational step. You need to have your development environment ready with the necessary tools and libraries before you can start building anything. Installing Next.js and the Pipecat SDKs is essential to proceed.

1. **Initialize Next.js Project:**
- Use npx create-next-app@latest to create a new React application with Next.js .
- Choose TypeScript for the project.
1. **Install Dependencies:**
- Install the core Pipecat JavaScript SDK, the Pipecat React SDK, and the Daily transport:
    
    Bash
    
    npm install @pipecat-ai/client-js @pipecat-ai/client-react @pipecat-ai/daily-transport
    
    or
    
    Bash
    
    yarn add @pipecat-ai/client-js @pipecat-ai/client-react @pipecat-ai/daily-transport
    
1. **Set up Environment Variables:**
- Create a .env.local file in the project root.
- Add necessary environment variables, such as the Pipecat API base URL (PIPECAT_API_URL) and any Daily API keys if required .

### **Stage 2: Core UI Structure**

Building the basic layout and integrating the camera component early on allows you to visualize the user interface and ensure the core functionality of capturing video is working independently before connecting to the backend. This separation helps in debugging and iterating on the UI.

1. **Create Basic Layout:**
- Set up the main layout components using Next.js's app directory structure (or pages if using an older version).
- Include basic navigation and structure for different sections (e.g., landing page, camera view).
1. **Implement Camera Component:**
- Investigate the https://github.com/Rob-24-ai/dailyco-camera-3-18-25 repository for the Camera component implementation.
- Integrate this component into your Next.js application to display the camera feed.
- Ensure the component allows selection of the rear-facing camera if necessary.
1. **Create Pipecat Client Provider:**
- Wrap your application with the RTVIClientProvider from the @pipecat-ai/client-react SDK to manage the Pipecat client instance 6.
- Initialize the RTVIClient within the provider, configuring the transport with DailyTransport 6.

### **Stage 3: Pipecat SDK Integration**

Once the basic UI and camera are in place, the next logical step is to integrate the Pipecat SDK to establish communication with the backend. Connecting to Pipecat and handling the camera stream using the SDK's components and hooks bridges the frontend and backend functionalities.

1. **Establish Connection:**
- Use the useRTVIClient hook from @pipecat-ai/client-react to access the RTVIClient instance within your components 6.
- Implement logic to connect to the Pipecat backend using client.connect() .
- Handle connection status and potential errors.
1. **Implement Camera Stream Handling:**
- Utilize the RTVIClientVideo component from @pipecat-ai/client-react to publish the video stream from your camera component to the Pipecat backend 6.
- Ensure the component is correctly configured to use the video track from your integrated camera component.
1. **Implement Basic Interaction Controls:**
- Create UI elements (e.g., buttons) to trigger actions or send messages to the Pipecat bot if needed (though the primary interaction here is video).

### **Stage 4: Camera Integration Details**

This stage focuses on refining the camera integration, particularly the rear camera functionality. Addressing these specific requirements after the initial integration ensures that the core video streaming is functional before tackling more detailed features.

1. **Analyze dailyco-camera-3-18-25 Repo:**
- Examine the code in the repository to understand how the camera feed is accessed and controlled.
- Identify any specific dependencies or setup requirements for the camera component.
1. **Adapt Camera Component:**
- Modify the camera component from the repository if necessary to ensure compatibility with the Pipecat React SDK and your application's structure.
- Ensure the component provides a MediaStreamTrack that can be used by the RTVIClientVideo component.
1. **Implement Rear Camera Functionality:**
- If the camera component doesn't inherently support rear camera selection, investigate the WebRTC getUserMedia API constraints to implement this feature 6.

### **Stage 5: Testing and Refinement**

Testing at various stages of development is crucial for identifying and fixing issues early. Testing locally and then with the Pipecat Cloud integration ensures that all parts of the application work together as expected. Iteration based on testing is a standard part of the development lifecycle.

1. **Local Testing:**
- Run your Next.js application locally using npm run dev or yarn dev.
- Test the camera functionality and the connection to the Pipecat backend.
- Verify that the rear-facing camera option works as expected.
1. **Pipecat Cloud Integration Testing:**
- Deploy your Pipecat bot to Pipecat Cloud if you haven't already .
- Test the complete integration between your frontend UI and the deployed Pipecat Cloud Vision Bot.
1. **Iterate and Refine:**
- Based on testing, identify and fix any bugs or issues.
- Refine the UI and UX as needed for a smooth user experience.
